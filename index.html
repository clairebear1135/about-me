                        For a short time, I was learning Korean with my sister because she wanted to teach English in S. Korea. That dream didn't happen, and now I can read Korean.. even if I can't understand all of it.

                        I dropped out of High School in 9th grade due to a vaccine dispute which led me to get my GED, then my driver's license.

                        I got second place in my middle school's spelling bee. When I went to state, I misspelled the word <i>hobnob</i>. Now I hate that word every time I see it. Who even uses hobnob..?
